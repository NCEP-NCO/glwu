for testing with canned data

This line is in j-job
#export DCOMIN=${DCOMIN:-${DCOMROOT}/prod} # serves ice and ndfd data

#set DCOMROOT in run.ver to set DCOMIN to this path
#location for testing canned data
export DCOMIN='/lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/GLWU/dcom/prod'

This must be copied to COMOUT first before running:
#for testing
cp /lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/GLWU/COM_wcoss1_prod/glwu.20211003/glwu.glwu.t01z.restart $COMOUT

I also set PDY in run.ver for a seemless transition to real data by changing run.ver only

KEEPDATA is set to yes in J-JOBs for testing mode
